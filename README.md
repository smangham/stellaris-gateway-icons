[b]Version 3.2.*[/b]
Keep losing your gateway construction sites? Wish they showed up on the map just like deactivated gateways did? 

[h1]Gateway Icons[/h1]
Every gateway construction site shows the same red 'Gateway in system' icon on the galactic map that deactivated gateways do. It's that simple.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod only changes one file, [i]megastructures/05_gateways.txt[/i].
